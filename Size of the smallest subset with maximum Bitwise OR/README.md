# Size of the smallest subset with maximum Bitwise OR

Given an array of positive integers. The task is to find the size of the smallest subset such that the Bitwise OR of that set is Maximum possible. 

Examples: 

Input : arr[] = {5, 1, 3, 4, 2}\
Output : 2\
7 is the maximum value possible of OR,\ 
5|2 = 7 and 5|3 = 7

Input : arr[] = {2, 6, 2, 8, 4, 5}\
Output : 3\
15 is the maximum value of OR and set
elements are 8, 6, 5
